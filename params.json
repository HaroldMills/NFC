{"name":"Vesper","tagline":"Open source software for nocturnal bird migration monitoring.","body":"The short-term goal of the Vesper project is to create software to help Bill Evans of [Old Bird](http://www.oldbird.org) organize and classify the millions of sound clips he has collected from his [Eastern North America acoustic monitoring transect](http://www.oldbird.org/Data/2013/TransNE2013/NETransect-2013.html).\r\n\r\nThough the short-term goal of the project is quite specific, Vesper is being designed with much wider application in mind. The long-term goal of the project is to create software to help the larger community of bird migration researchers and enthusiasts to collaboratively collect, view, and analyze nocturnal flight calls (NFCs) stored in web-based archives.\r\n\r\nVesper runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. It is implemented in the [Python](http://www.python.org) programming language and leverages various other open source projects, including [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org), [Matplotlib](http://www.matplotlib.org), [PyQt](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro), and [Qt](http://www.qt-project.org). We recommend running Vesper atop the free [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) scientific Python distribution from [Continuum Analytics](http://www.continuum.io/).\r\n\r\nVesper is not yet ready for widespread use, but for the intrepid there are preliminary [installation instructions](https://github.com/HaroldMills/Vesper/wiki/How-to-Install-Vesper).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

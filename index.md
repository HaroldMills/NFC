The goal of the Vesper project is to create open source software that enables both professional ornithologists and nonprofessional bird enthusiasts to collect, view, and analyze nocturnal flight calls (NFCs) of migratory birds at spatial scales ranging from local to continental.

Vesper has been used for several years by both individuals and teams to operate monitoring networks ranging in size from a single station to more than 50 stations, in the latter case collecting and analyzing several tens of thousands of hours of audio during each of two consecutive fall migration seasons.

Vesper is still very much a work in progress, and it is not yet as easy to use as it will eventually become. Nevertheless, experience has proven its utility, and so we provide this documentation to help additional users adopt Vesper for their own monitoring efforts. There are three main parts to the documentaion: installation instructions, a tutorial for new users, and a more systematic and thorough description of Vesper's design.

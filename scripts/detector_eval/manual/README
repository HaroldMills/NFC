This package contains scripts used to perform partially automatic,
partially manual evaluations of the MPG Ranch and BirdVoxDetect
detectors in early 2019.

For these evaluations, we:

* Selected one random August night for each 2018 MPG Ranch station.
* Ran BirdVoxDetect 0.1.a0 AT 05 on recordings.
* Ran MPG Ranch Thrush Detector 0.0 40 and MPG Ranch Tseep Detector
  0.0 40 on recordings.
* Deleted detected clips with scores below a threshold that varies
  with station-night. The threshold is at most 80, so that we retain
  all clips with that threshold or more to ensure that we will be
  able to plot precision vs. number of detected calls for threholds
  80-100. We lower the threshold below 80 as needed to get at least
  3000 clips for each station-night when possible. It is not always
  possible, since for some station-nights there are fewer than 3000
  detections.
* Transferred call classifications from Old Bird Redux 1.1 clips to
  new detector clips.

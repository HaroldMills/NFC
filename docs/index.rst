Acoustic Monitoring With Vesper
===============================

Vesper is open source software for acoustic monitoring of nocturnal
bird migration. Vesper aims to enable a wide range of users, including
both bird enthusiasts and professional ornithologists, to
collaboratively collect, view, and analyze nocturnal flight calls
(NFCs) of migratory birds at a wide range of project scales.

Vesper has been used for several years by individuals and teams to
operate acoustic monitoring networks ranging in size from a single
recording station to more than 50 stations. In the latter case, a
team of researchers at `MPG Ranch <https://www.mpgranch.com/>`_
used Vesper to collect and analyze several tens of
thousands of hours of audio during each of two consecutive fall
migration seasons. We intend that Vesper will eventually be able to
support much larger projects, involving networks comprising hundreds
or even thousands of monitoring stations operated by large teams
of people. Even as the size of projects that Vesper can support
grows, however, we will continue to improve its utility for smaller
projects, including single-station ones.

Vesper is still very much a work in progress, and as such is not yet
as full-featured and easy to use as it will be eventually.
Nevertheless, experience has proved its utility for a range of users,
and so we provide this documentation to help additional users adopt
Vesper for their own monitoring efforts. We hope that Vesper will
prove valuable to you, and welcome feedback that will help us improve
it.

This documentation currently comprises installation instructions and
a beginner's tutorial. Additional documentation is under development.

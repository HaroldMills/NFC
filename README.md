Vesper
======

Vesper is open source software for acoustical monitoring of nocturnal bird migration.

The goal of the Vesper project is to create software that will enable researchers and enthusiasts to collaboratively collect, view, and analyze nocturnal flight calls (NFCs) of migratory birds at spatial scales ranging from local to continental.

There are currently two versions of Vesper available: version 0.1 and version 0.2. Vesper 0.1 is an older desktop application that is no longer under development, and Vesper version 0.2 is a newer web application where all development effort is focused. Because Vesper 0.2 is relatively new, it is not yet as functional as Vesper 0.1, and we recommend it for testing purposes only. Vesper 0.1 is still recommended over Vesper 0.2 for day-to-day use. When the web application is ready for day-to-day use we will increment its version number to 0.3 and deprecate the use of Vesper 0.1 and 0.2. We expect Vesper 0.3 to appear during the fall of 2016.

As a web application, Vesper 0.2 comprises two parts, the *server* and the *client*. The server stores and processes audio data and metadata while the client runs in a web browser to provide the user interface. The server and client can run on the same computer for personal or small group use, or the server can run on a separate computer and serve multiple clients for larger deployments.

No version of Vesper is ready for widespread use just yet, but for the intrepid there are preliminary [installation instructions](https://github.com/HaroldMills/Vesper/wiki/Installing-and-Updating-Vesper) for both Vesper 0.1 and Vesper 0.2.

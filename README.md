Vesper
======

Vesper is open source software for acoustical monitoring of nocturnal bird migration.

The goal of the Vesper project is to create software that will enable researchers and enthusiasts to collaboratively collect, view, and analyze nocturnal flight calls (NFCs) of migratory birds at spatial scales ranging from local to continental.

Vesper versions through 0.1.3 are desktop applications, but beginning with version 0.2.0 Vesper is a web application. The server part of the application stores and processes audio data while the client part runs in a web browser to provide the user interface. The client and server can run on the same computer for personal or small group use, or the server can run on a separate computer and serve multiple clients for larger deployments.

Versions 0.2.x of Vesper are less functional than version 0.1.3, and are offered for testing purposes only. Vesper 0.3.0 will be the first version of the web application that is deemed ready for day-to-day use, and will probably appear during the fall of 2016.

Neither the desktop nor the web version of Vesper is ready for widespread use, but for the intrepid there are preliminary [installation instructions](https://github.com/HaroldMills/Vesper/wiki/Installing-and-Updating-Vesper).

Many thanks to [MPG Ranch](http://mpgranch.com), [Old Bird](http://oldbird.org), and an anonymous donor for financial support of the Vesper project.

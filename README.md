NFC
===

The NFC project contains the *NFC Tools*, open source software for studying avian nocturnal flight calls (NFCs).

The short-term goal of the project is to create tools to help Bill Evans of [Old Bird](http://www.oldbird.org) organize and classify the millions of sound clips he has collected from his [Eastern North America acoustic monitoring transect](http://www.oldbird.org/Data/2013/TransNE2013/NETransect-2013.html).

Though the short-term goal of the project is quite specific, the tools are being designed with much wider application in mind. The long-term goal of the project is to create tools to help the larger community of NFC researchers and enthusiasts to collaboratively collect, view, and analyze NFCs stored in web-accessible archives.

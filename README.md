Vesper
======

Vesper is open source software for acoustical monitoring of nocturnal bird migration.

The goal of the Vesper project is to create software that will enable researchers and enthusiasts to collaboratively collect, view, and analyze nocturnal flight calls (NFCs) of migratory birds at spatial scales ranging from local to continental.

Vesper versions through 0.1.3 were desktop applications, but beginning with version 0.2.0 Vesper will be a web application. The web application will have two parts, the *Vesper Client* and the *Vesper Server*. The Vesper Client will run in a web browser and provide the application's user interface. The Vesper Client will communicate via HTTP with the Vesper Server, which will store audio data and perform most signal processing operations. Vesper 0.2.0 will be released sometime during the fall of 2016.

Vesper is not yet ready for widespread use, but for the intrepid there are preliminary [installation instructions](https://github.com/HaroldMills/Vesper/wiki/Installing-and-Updating-Vesper).

Many thanks to [MPG Ranch](http://mpgranch.com), [Old Bird](http://oldbird.org), and an anonymous donor for financial support of the Vesper project.

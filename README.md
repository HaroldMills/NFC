Vesper
======

Vesper is open source software for acoustical nocturnal bird migration monitoring.

The goal of the Vesper project is to create software that will enable researchers and enthusiasts to collaboratively collect, view, and analyze nocturnal flight calls (NFCs) of migratory birds at a continental scale. Vesper will also streamline monitoring at smaller scales.

Vesper runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. It is implemented in the [Python](http://www.python.org) programming language and leverages various other open source projects, including [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org), [Matplotlib](http://www.matplotlib.org), [PyQt](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro), and [Qt](http://www.qt-project.org). We recommend running Vesper atop the free [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) scientific Python distribution from [Continuum Analytics](http://www.continuum.io/).

Vesper is not yet ready for widespread use, but for the intrepid there are preliminary [installation instructions](https://github.com/HaroldMills/Vesper/wiki/How-to-Install-Vesper).

Many thanks to [MPG Ranch](http://mpgranch.com), [Old Bird](http://oldbird.org), and an anonymous donor for financial support of the Vesper project.

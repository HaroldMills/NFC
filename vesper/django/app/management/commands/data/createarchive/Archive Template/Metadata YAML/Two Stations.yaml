# This is an example Vesper archive data YAML file. You can use such
# files to specify data to be imported into your Vesper archive, either
# to initialize the archive just after you create it, or to add
# additional data to it later. The file uses the YAML data format,
# which you can read about at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML.
#
# It is helpful to think of an archive data file as comprising one or
# more *sections* with the titles:
#
#     stations
#     device_models
#     devices
#     station_devices
#     detectors
#     classifiers
#     annotation_constraints
#     annotations
#
# Which sections are present in a particular archive data YAML file
# depends on the sort(s) of information that the file specifies.
# For example, a file like this one that initializes an archive
# might include all of the sections, while another file that is used
# later to add some new detectors to an archive might include only
# a "detectors" section. Each section can occur at most once in a
# file.


# The "stations" section specifies the recording stations of your archive,
# where each station includes a name and a location. The latitude and
# longitude of a station should be specified in degrees, and the elevation
# in meters. If you don't know the elevations of your stations, don't
# worry about it: just specify zero. Vesper currently makes no use of
# the elevation, though a future version might use it.
#
# A station also includes an associated set of recording devices,
# specifically recorders and microphones. These are specified in the
# "device_models", "devices", and "station_devices" sections, below.
# Vesper relies on this information to keep track of which recorder
# and microphone was used to record each channel of each recording
# of your archive.

# The "devices" section specifies the actual physical devices used to make
# the recordings of an archive. Each device must be uniquely identified by
# the combination of its name and serial number. Feel free to make up
# serial numbers if you do not know them (you can correct your made-up
# serial numbers later if you wish) or if you just don't care to track
# them. Note also that serial numbers can include non-numeric characters.
# For example, "ABC" and "001X2" are valid serial numbers.
#
# Through the types of information provided in the "devices" and
# "station_devices" sections (the "station_devices" section follows the
# "devices" section), Vesper allows you to keep track of changes in the
# set of devices that you used at a given station to make its recordings.
# Note that you do not have to track such changes if you don't want to.
# For example, you might specify a single recorder and microphone for
# each of your stations in both the "devices" and "station_devices"
# sections, giving the devices made-up serial numbers, even if you
# sometimes replace defective devices with others of the same model
# during your recording season.

# The "station_devices" section specifies the recording devices used at
# your stations, including the names and serial numbers of the devices,
# the dates at which they were used, and how the devices are connected.
#
# A connection is specified as the device output and device input that
# are connected. A device output or input is specified as the combination
# of a device name, a serial number, and an output or input name,
# respectively. An output or input name comprises the word "Output" or
# "Input" followed by an output or input number, beginning with 0.
# So, for example, the first input of a recorder named "Recorder" with
# serial number "10" is specified as "Recorder 10 Input 0". If a device
# has only one input or output (which is usually the case for a microphone,
# and often for a recorder), the input or output number can be omitted.
# So, for example, if a microphone with name "21c" and serial number
# "10" has just one output, that output can be specified as
# "21c 10 Output".

      description: >
          Classifies an unclassified clip as a "Call" if it appears to be
          a nocturnal flight call, or as a "Noise" otherwise. Does not
          classify a clip that has already been classified, whether
          manually or automatically. For use in conjunction with the Old
          Bird Thrush and Tseep detectors.

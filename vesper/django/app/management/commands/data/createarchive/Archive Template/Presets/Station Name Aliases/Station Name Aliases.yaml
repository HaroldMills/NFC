# A station name aliases preset is a mapping from the "official"
# station names stored in the archive database to lists of aliases
# for them that appear in recording file names. The archive station
# names should be capitalized exactly they are in the archive. The
# capitalization of aliases is irrelevant since they and the
# station names that appear in file names are converted to lower
# case before comparison.
#
# The example mapping below is commented out to disable it. You
# would remove the first two characters (the pound sign and the
# first space) of each line to enable the mapping.

# Ithaca:
#     - ith
#     - ith000

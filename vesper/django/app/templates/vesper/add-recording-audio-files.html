    <h2>Add recording audio files</h2>

    <p>
        Adds audio files for recordings already in this Vesper archive.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This command is intended for use with Vesper web archives
        that were populated from old Vesper desktop archives by
        running the <code>populate_archive</code> script. Desktop
        archives included recording metadata but not recording audio
        files, and the <code>populate_archive</code> script did not
        change this in the web archives it populated. This command
        remedies that by matching the recording files present in
        the web archive's recording directories to recordings in
        the archive database, and adding the recordings to the
        database.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The command logs warning messages for any problems it finds,
        for example if it can't find files for a recording, or if
        the sample rate or number of channels of the files does
        not match that of the recording. It is safe to run the
        command repeatedly, fixing selected problems noted in the
        logs between runs, until you are satisfied with the results
        of the final run. Files added by one execution of the
        command will simply be passed over on subsequent runs.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        If you check the <code>Dry run</code> check box, the command
        will do everything it normally does, including writing all of
        its normal log messages, but it will not actually modify the
        database.
    </p>

    <p class="warning">
        It is strongly recommended that you save a backup copy of
        your <code>Archive Database.sqlite</code> file
        before running this command. If you do that, then if after
        running the command you decide you don't like the results,
        you can restore your database to its state before you ran
        the command.

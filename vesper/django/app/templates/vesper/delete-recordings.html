  <h2>Delete Recordings</h2>
  
  <p>
    Deletes recordings from this archive. The recordings are specified as a
    set of stations and a range of dates. All data associated with the
    recordings, except for the recording sound files if present, are deleted
    from the archive, including recording metadata, clips (including clip
    sound files), and annotations. The deletion runs as a Vesper job. This
    operation cannot be undone, so be careful!
  </p>

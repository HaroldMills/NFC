    <h2>Import Archive Data</h2>

    <p>
        Imports archive data from YAML text into Vesper. The YAML can describe
        stations, devices (such as microphones and recorders), which devices were
        used at which stations during which time periods, and how the devices were
        connected (for example, which microphones were connected to which recorder
        channels). It can also describe algorithms, algorithm versions, and
        processors. The import runs as a Vesper job. [Need to describe archive
        data YAML format in more detail, perhaps on another page that we link to
        here.]

    /*
     * Computes the forward DFT of a real sequence.
     *
     * The DFT size n must be a power of two, and the input and output
     * arrays must have length n. On return, the output array contains the DFT
     * of the input array and the input array is unmodified. The real parts of
     * elements 0 through n / 2 of the DFT are stored in the corresponding
     * output array elements, and the imaginary parts of DFT elements 1
     * through n / 2 - 1 are stored in output array elements n - 1 through
     * n / 2 + 1, respectively (i.e. in reverse order from the end of the
     * array).
     *
     * Note that the output array does not include the imaginary
     * parts of DFT elements 0 and n / 2, since these are necessarily zero.
     * The output array also does not include DFT elements n / 2 + 1 through
     * n - 1, since these are the complex conjugates of the included elements
     * n / 2 - 1 through 1 (in reverse order), respectively.
     *
     * The code in this file has a long history. It is derived most
     * immediately from a portion of Corban Brook's dsp.js
     * (https://github.com/corbanbrook/dsp.js). The relevant portion of
     * dsp.js was in turn derived from code that is part of JÃ¶rg Arndt's FXT
     * library (see the file realfftsplitradix.cc of https://www.jjj.de/fxt,
     * and also pages 434-435 of Arndt's book Matters Computational, at
     * http://www.jjj.de/fxt/fxtbook.pdf). According to comments in Arndt's
     * code, it was derived from an original Fortran FFT (available at
     * https://www.jjj.de/fft/sorensen.tgz) that Sorensen et al. published
     * in the paper "Real-valued fast Fourier Transform Algorithms"
     * (IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,
     * Volume 35, Issue 6, June 1987, pp. 849-863), which was also
     * adapted to C by Bill Simpson in 1995 (see
     * https://www.jjj.de/fft/rsplitfft.c).
